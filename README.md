# Mission Statement
Our mission is to empower Content Creators and Businesses to fund their passion with the best monetisation options from Web2 and Web3.

Our monetisation options include Creator Tokens, Memberships, Licensing of Collectibles and Connect! We also support Crypto and Fiat payment methods for all these options.

Note: Creator Tokens and Licensing of Collectibles are Web3 concepts driven by NFT technology. Memberships and Connect are standard Web2 concepts.

# Problems and Solutions
Problem #1: High barrier to entry in the current NFT space. Lots of wallets, multiple fund transfers and gas fees just to buy an NFT. The average person(90%+ of the population) has too much of a learning curve to participate.

Solution: A simple Web+Mobile experience for the average person. The Creator Nation mobile app acts as a wallet without requiring the user to know what a wallet is. Additionally, we support Stripe payments to provide a seamless experience to Web2 users. (Crypto enthusiasts can use the standard Web3-Metamask interface.)

Problem #2: Transactional relationship between NFT owner and buyer. Most NFTs are just Images/GIFs with no benefits. Our view is that the future of NFTs lies in its ability to provide value to holders beyond a quick profit.

Solution: We enable fans to invest in Creators through Creator Tokens. Holders of the token get exclusive benefits for holding and make an ROI on sale. Creators can further reward their communities by offering token based rewards and dividends.

# Inspiration
A firm believer that the best products are those that deliver a truly excellent user experience to everyone, regardless of whether they are industry experts or not. Watching the entire world struggle to explain the NFT phenomenon, let alone their benefits and the procedure to buy them, struck a chord with me. I built on that thought, talked to a few people, and here is Creator Nation as it is today.

Bringing Web2 and Web3 elements together on a single platform.
Use of ERC 1155 standard to provide non fungible aspect.
L2 scaling using Polygon for faster UX.
Decentralised storage using IPFS
Learning and using Alchemy and Scaffold-ETH.
Challenges we faced and What we learned
Implementing Smart Contracts and building and NFT Marketplace.
Integrating Stripe to accept payments for the NFTs(Web3 elements of the website).
WalletConnect SDK to make our mobile app act as the wallet to the website.
